# Apps

Deploying an app in Prezel means simply importing some Github repository, public or private, from your Github account.
Every app will have automatically one production domain.
If you deploy apps with `prezel.app`, the production domain will be `<your-app-name>.<your-server-name>.prezel.app`. For intance, if your server is called `red-squirrel` and you app is called `chat`, the production domain will be `maps.red-squirrel.prezel.app`.

Support for other git platforms is planned for future releases.

## Templates

You can choose among one of the prezel templates to get started quickly. To do so just head to [prezel.app/new-app](https://prezel.app/new-app) and select any of them. This will create a new repository in yout Github account and deploy an app from it.
