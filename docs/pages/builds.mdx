# Builds

Builds are triggered against the root directory of your repository, unless a different path is provided as root folder explicitly.
Normally, the build step of your apps will be carried out by Nixpacks, which means if your repository contains an app defined using any of the supported frameworks, everything will work automatically, with no configuration required.
If however your repository contains a Dockerfile at the root folder, that will take precedence and will be used to define the container that hosts your app.

# Nixpacks

If your repository doesn't contain a Dockerfile, Nixpacks will take care of building your app. You can refer to their documentation here:

</Cards>

To customize the build process, you can add a `nixpacks.toml` file in the root folder.
You can find more information about the available options [here](https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/file).

    The exception are static sites, whose support in the Nixpacks ecosystem falls a bit behind.
    I need to explain the cases where a static output will be detected
