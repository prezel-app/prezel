# Quick Start


The easiest way to deploy your first application to your server is by using our public console [prezel.app](https://prezel.app).
Just create an account and you will be prompted with some instructions and the command you need to run in your server to get prezel setup.
You won't need to setup any Github application, DNS records, email server, etc. Once your server is setup, the experience will be similar to the one you get when using services like Vercel.

Once your server is setup, you will be able to deploy apps on it. The easiest way of doing so is heading to [prezel.app/new-app](https://prezel.app/new-app) and deploying one of our templates.
