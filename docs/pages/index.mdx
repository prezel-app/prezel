# Welcome to Prezel!


Prezel is an open source platform for deploying web applications and services built around Github.

The experience of using Prezel is very similar to that of Vercel, but with one huge difference: you own the server.

This means you can pay directly to your server provider, with no intermediaries, lowering the biggest part of your spending.
What's more, you can even run it in your own computer, Raspberry Pi, etc.

For instance, this documentation is being hosted in a Prezel instance hosted by Hetzner.
